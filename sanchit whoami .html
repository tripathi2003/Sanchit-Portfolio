        <p>Hello, my name is <span> <a href="" id="link">Daniel Lee! </a></span> I am a recent a graduate at Drexel
            University,
            from the the class of 2023, with
            a B.S in Computing and Security Technology (cybersecurity).
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Growing up, my interest in cybersecurity sparked after experiencing a DDoS attack while gaming. Determined
            to outsmart attackers, I delved deeper into the field to safeguard my network. Additionally, I enjoyed
            solving puzzles, even when the pieces were mismatched. These experiences naturally steered me towards a
            career in threat mitigation and incident response.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Throughout my academic journey, I had the opportunity to learn about a field that I was truly passionate
            about. I have taken a variety of challenging courses including networking, cryptography, business continuity
            and disaster recovery, and more. Alongside this, I had the chance to complete many different projects in
            relevance to security topics.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            In addition to my academic pursuits, I have also gained real world experience through two internships I had
            at Comcast Corporation as a Data Analyst. During my time at Comcast, I worked on several projects which
            helped me develop skills in data cleaning, visualization, and interpretation by using a wide variety of
            tools including SQL and Tableau. Although I have experience as a data analyst, I’m passionate about
            transitioning my career into cybersecurity. My previous experiences in data analysis has taught me the
            importance of paying close attention to small details, identifying trends and patterns, critical thinking,
            and communication especially with tools and visuals I did not understand. Asking questions to my manager and
            team members helped me grow with my skillset and problem solving which converted into efficient and
            effective workflow.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            In summary, I am passionate and excited to bring my experiences both in the classroom, in my projects, and
            my internships at Comcast to transition into the world of security where I can contribute to the protection
            of a company’s vital digital assets and succeed with their commitment and mission.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to discussing my qualifications in further
            detail!
